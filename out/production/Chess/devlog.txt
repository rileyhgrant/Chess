============
I scrapped the old one. I can go back to trying to do it with MVC later, but I kind of borked it.
The view was holding too much data. I think ideally, the model just holds the data, and maybe
processes logic.

The controller serves to get requests from the view, and pass that info along to the model.
The view is rigged up to the controller, in this case the view is basically a 8x8 grid of
tiles that just act as buttons. No data is stored. A click just tells the controller what
space was clicked, and the it passes to the model to do all its proper stuff

Anyways,

I'm about to call it for the night. It's 12:30 in the morning. I can pretty easily implement the
turns, I think the easiest way is to just nest an if. When a click happens, check if it
is on a piece of the player who's turn it is. If not, then legit don't do shit. Use a break or
something.

like:

if (notMyPiece()) {
  return;
}
