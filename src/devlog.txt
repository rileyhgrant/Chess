==========
At long last I'm back to working on this. One 3 week canoe trip and one GRE study sesh later.

I got graphics, need to center those a bit but in general most of the basic functionality works

Todo:
. Implement check and rules surrounding that (yikes)
. Implement checkmate (easier once you have check)
. Implement en passent for pawns (probably have groundwork)
. Implement castling for King (have groundwork)
. Implement menu at the beginning
. flip colors, I believe that white always goes first
. Implement score at bottom of screen
. Implement legal move as a lil grey dot? maybe? just like chess.com
. change path of files to be out of my downloads, make it relative so anyone can play?
  . Really I can just use the ./bla/bla and keep it in the same directory

============
I scrapped the old one. I can go back to trying to do it with MVC later, but I kind of borked it.
The view was holding too much data. I think ideally, the model just holds the data, and maybe
processes logic.

The controller serves to get requests from the view, and pass that info along to the model.
The view is rigged up to the controller, in this case the view is basically a 8x8 grid of
tiles that just act as buttons. No data is stored. A click just tells the controller what
space was clicked, and the it passes to the model to do all its proper stuff

Anyways,

I'm about to call it for the night. It's 12:30 in the morning. I can pretty easily implement the
turns, I think the easiest way is to just nest an if. When a click happens, check if it
is on a piece of the player who's turn it is. If not, then legit don't do shit. Use a break or
something.

like:

if (notMyPiece()) {
  return;
}

Anyways, there are a few more difficult things. Currently the piece is just returning a bunch of
gobbledy gook. Maybe the piece should return a more specific set of things, you can
have the method for the one look into the game's static board for like, pawn taking, and adding
to row and col for Rook's or Bishops.

The generic checking for a friendly piece occupying and preventing IOB can take place in the
place where its happenign now. easy peasy.

Getting there. As ol' Musky says, if you work 80-100 hour weeks and everyone else is working
40 hour weeks, you'll get done in less than half the time, or accomplish twice as much.

I'm not doing anything quite as innovative-ey as Musky. but I can put in the work, gosh dang it.

When I get back from canoeing - fresh hair cut, shave the beard. Study for 4 hours per day,
program for 8 hours per day, and play music for 1. Rest of time, read, eat, exercise.

4 + 8 + 1 = 13. Legit you have 11 other hours to fit everything else in. Count 8 for sleep,
then you have 3 hours to read, exercise, eat, and socialize. Easy.

Anyways, I'll have plenty of time to think on this canoe trip. Get Chess to a decent point tomorrow
